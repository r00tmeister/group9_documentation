## Performance
- Scalability: The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle a growing
number of users and increased data load without performance degradation. This
includes the ability to add more instances of the web server and database as
needed.
- Throughput: The system should be able to support multiple concurrent users
without a significant drop in performance.
- Caching: Caching mechanisms should be implemented to reduce server load and
improve response times.

## Safety

- Data Integrity: Ensure all requests are processed accurately and data is consistently
maintained across the system. Implement database constraints and transactional integrity
checks.
- Fault Tolerance: The system should be able to recover from hardware or software failures.
This includes automatic failover mechanisms and redundancy in critical components.
- Error Handling: Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the application. All
errors should be logged, and appropriate user-friendly messages should be displayed to the
users.
- Backups: Regular backups of all critical data should be performed and stored securely. Ensure
that a disaster recovery plan is in place and tested periodically

## Security

- Authentication and Authorization: All users must be authenticated using a secure
authentication mechanism (e.g., OAuth2, JWT). Implement role-based access control
to ensure users only have access to the resources they are authorized to use.
- Data Encryption: All sensitive data, both at rest and in transit, must be encrypted
using industry-standard encryption protocols.
- Security Audits: Security audits and penetration testing can be used to identify and
mitigate vulnerabilities. Follow best practices and comply with relevant security standards and regulations.

## Software Quality

- Code Quality: Ensure high code quality by following coding standards and best
practices. Conduct regular code reviews.
- Testing: Implement a comprehensive testing strategy that includes unit tests,
integration tests, system tests, and user acceptance tests. Aim for high test coverage
to ensure the reliability of the codebase.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Utilize CI/CD pipelines to
automate the build, testing, and deployment processes. This helps in detecting and
fixing issues early and ensures that changes are delivered quickly and reliably.
- Documentation: Maintain up-to-date and comprehensive documentation for the
entire system, including code comments, API documentation, user manuals, and
operation guides.
- Usability: Design the application with a user-centric approach, ensuring that it is
intuitive and easy to use. Conduct usability testing to gather feedback and make
necessary improvements.
- Maintainability: Ensure the system is easy to maintain by modularizing the code,
following design patterns, and keeping dependencies up to date. Document the
architecture and design decisions to aid future maintenance efforts.
